# 🛡️ RansomGuard

**RansomShield** is a lightweight and effective anti-ransomware tool designed to detect, alert, and mitigate ransomware activity in real time using a combination of:

- 🔒 **Blacklist-based hash detection**
- 🧬 **YARA rule scanning**
- 🪤 **Honeypot trap monitoring**

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Hash Blacklisting:** Detects known ransomware executables using a curated blacklist of malicious file hashes (MD5, SHA256, etc.).
- **YARA Integration:** Scans files using custom or community-provided YARA rules to catch suspicious behaviors or patterns.
- **Honeypot System:** Monitors decoy folders/files for unauthorized access or encryption attempts.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Instantly notifies when ransomware-like behavior is detected.
- **Quarantine Support:** Automatically isolates detected malicious files to prevent further damage.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Startup Scan:** On launch, RansomShield loads the hash blacklist and YARA rules.
2. **Honeypot Deployment:** A hidden or decoy directory is deployed and monitored for changes.
3. **Continuous Monitoring:** The tool runs in the background, monitoring:
   - File executions against the blacklist.
   - Real-time file changes via YARA rules.
   - Unauthorized access to honeypots.
4. **Response:** On detection:
   - Malicious processes can be terminated.
   - Files moved to quarantine.
   - Logs and alerts are generated for admins or users.
